<h1 align="center">The problem with Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and how it can be better</h1>

---

## 1. Introduction

There has been increasing importance on the role of vaccines and their ability to protect the well-being of society and has also played a historical role in fulfilling the eradication of historic diseases, as to why it is essential that the current COVID-19 vaccines are distributed efficiently to provide long-term protection to populations. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has raised concerns to the logistics of vaccines, overall delivery of vaccines, and the prioritisation of vaccinations among the Australian population. This issue will be analysed and understood through a series of models which further conclude in potential solutions.  

## 2. Context
### 2.1. Stakeholders
COVID-19 vaccination rollout programs/systems have differed by country to country, depending on the various circumstances of each. However, in Australia's, case the rollout of a vaccine has been unsuccessful. With PM Scott Morrisson abandoning the national vaccine rollout program on the 12th of April (ABC News, 2021). Thus, causing various elements of the media, academia, and government to look for alternative solutions for an effective vaccine rollout.  

The media is addressing the problem by analyising other vaccine rollout, to see what Australia can learn from them, while also using the opinion of various Australian medical professionals in industry. From example the Guardian published an article listing the best vaccine rollout programs from the world and suggested how Australia can learn from them. While other outlets recognize the problem more as one, which is putting frontline workers at risk (Mirage, 2021)

Industry specialists such as doctors and healthcare professionals view the problem as one not only from ineffective government policy in administering the vaccine but also one that can be blamed on general public's reluctance to get the vaccine. Dr Khorshid the president of the Australian Medical Association stating "Our problem in the past was a lack of vaccines, but just in the last week or so, we've got a new problem and that is Australians have lost confidence in the vaccines." (Zagon, 2021). With some blaming this reluctance on “political overcorrection” (Wolfenden, 2021). 

The stakeholders in this problem could be considered as encompassing the whole of Australia. Considering that it is an issue of public health, which effects everyone. However, the main stakeholders who have a personal stake in this problem being resolved. The first major stakeholder are the state and federal governments. The federal government is InCharge in the rollout of the vaccine and wants to achieve herd immunity as soon as possible. The Government is also desperate for the vaccine to be implemented as the economy has suffered due to measures being taken to stop COVID-19. With Australia experiencing its first recession in 3 decades in 2020 (Janda & Lasker, 2020). This economic downturn due to COVID-19, has also made business a vested stakeholder in the efficient and effective rollout of the vaccine. 

### 2.2. Widely used models
#### SIR model 
The SIR model has long been ***the model*** for epidemiologists, in large part because it can calculate the happenings of an epidemic with only a handful of variables (size of population, infection rate,and recover rate). The model ignores the effects that the response of a population can have, but is still immensely useful as the first step. Because of this, almost everyone has seen the SIR model's infected population "curve", leading to the universal usage of "flatten the curve" at the beginning of the pandemic.

#### Continuous signalling model
As the lockdowns lengthen, the antivax movement gained traction in Australia (Loomes, 2021). Whether the growth and passion of this group is natural or artificial, it has become a problem. This has the potential to become a barrier to herd immunity if the number of antivaxxers get large enough. The signalling model explains why government and public healthcare officials have made numerous statements supporting the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. This, however, may have the opposite effect on people who distrust the government.

### 2.3 Limitations
The Continuous signalling model, employed by political figures to battle the antivax movement, has proven unsucessful (Wolfenden, 2021). The politician's unwillingness to take a harder stance is to blame. By doing less than what they could, and should, the leaders are letting the problem continue, lest they offend their constituents. This can cause even more people to lose confidence in the government, the vaccine rollout, and even the vaccines themselves. If left undealt with, the antivax movement has the potential to become a roadblock to Australia's herd immunity.

Even ignoring the antivax movement, Australia still have many problems to solve in order to reach its target of 200,000 doses-a-day by October. Due to international politics, logistical errors, lack of transparency, and a whole host of other problems, Australia has been slow in delivering vaccine to its citizens. Despite CSL, the local manufacturer of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, ramping up its production capacity, supply has not met demand. Experts have identified manufacturing capabilities as the main bottleneck to immunizing Australians (Sas, 2021).

## 3. Suggested models
#### Agent Based Models
Agent-Based modelling simulates the interactions of “agents” towards other agents and their environment which they are set in, with the consideration of the rules applied to its environment. It allows for the modelling of individual interactions and its often limitless, hence, its fundamental use in understanding complex systems. These models assist in the understanding of different properties and behaviours of agents within dynamic systems (Bonabeau, 2002) and offers a strong representation of real-world situations.  Regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, this model enables for the focus of the efficiency on rollout methods and the dynamic relationships of individuals complex behaviours (Shan & Yang, 2008).  

#### Alternate path model
Alternate path models provide an insight on different pathways a process can be carried out to which the most optimal path is chosen. Shortest path algorithms must be calculated which include the logistics of transporting the vaccines to health professionals, then to unvaccinated individuals.  Different pathways will be considered however in the circumstance of COVID-19 and its fast transmission, it is evident that the speed optimisation holds the most importance.   

Alternate path models will also provide extremely useful in vaccine rollouts and their costs. This includes the costs that apply to the government and individuals. Alternate path modelling will further find the most optimal pathway that reduces the overall cost of administering the vaccines.

*If we need an actual different third model, then we can use the network models – helps us understand how individuals interact with each other e.g., transmission - health professionals are more connected to the public whilst others in rural areas are less likely to come in contact with those in high density populations*
